      <p>
        I am a seasoned software expert who has developed products for
        enterprise clients such as Intuit, Yale University, and Hewlett-Packard
        (HP), as well as many venture-backed businesses. I specialize in
        building applications specific to the business needs of my clients. I
        have done work in software development, mobile app creation,
        front-end/back-end web, database/server management, graphic design, and
        video game development.

        I am passionate about building excellent software that improves the
        lives of those around me. I specialize in creating software for clients
        ranging from individuals and small-businesses all the way to large
        enterprise corporations. What would you do if you had a software expert
        available at your fingertips?
